* Conclusion
I have to switch back to X11, because wlroots/sway have nearly zero support for IMEs.
I need input method support for much of the work that I do as a linguist: IPA, Chinese, Cherokee.
I use emacs for writing which provides some lovely input method support but that doesn't extend to my browser (the main other place).
If I need to google search in Chinese or Japanese I'm forced to type it out in Emacs or Google Translate.
Even if it's not *all* the time, it's frequent enough.
